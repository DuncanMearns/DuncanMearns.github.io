Iâ€™m a CV Starr postdoctoral fellow in the [Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu/) and [McBride](https://mcbridelab.princeton.edu/) labs at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute studying the evolution of courtship behavior in insects. I did my PhD in the Baier lab at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Munich, where I studied prey capture behavior in zebrafish larvae. I was born and raised in Aberdeen, UK, and studied Natural Sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge.
