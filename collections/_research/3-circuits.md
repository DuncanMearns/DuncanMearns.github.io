_Nothing in neuroethology makes sense except in the light of behavioral evolution_.

The evolution of jaws was critical for the radiation of vertebrates, improving respiration efficiency and faciliting the diversification of feeding stragies that opened up new ecological niches for fishes. Evolution has subsequently co-opted jaws for a variety of other behaviors, including communication, aggression and emotional expression. Despite the importance of jaws for vertebrate evolution, the neural circuits that control jaw movements are poorly characterized. I have identified a population of neurons in the reticular formation - an import brainstem region for movement control - that play a critical role in generating fast jaw movements in fish. I am in the process of writing up this research, which will be available as a preprint soon!
