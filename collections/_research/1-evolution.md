_Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution_.

Behaviors do not arise _de novo_, but evolve like any other biological trait. How changes in the genome effect changes in neural circuits that, in turn, generate new behavioral phenotypes is not known. I am interested in understanding how neural circuits change over evolution to generate new, adaptive behavioral strategies. Male fruit flies perform elaborate "song-and-dance" courtship rituals to attract mates. These courtship rituals exhibit remarkable interspecies variation and evolve rapidly. In my current research, I investigate how neural circuits evolved to produce these diverse species-specific behaviors.
