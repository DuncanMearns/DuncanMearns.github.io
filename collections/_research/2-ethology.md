_Nothing in neuroscience makes sense except in the light of behavior_.

Brains generate behavior, which is the primary mechanism by which animals interact with the world. Thus, a thorough understanding of behavior is essential if we are to understand neural circuit function. In my research, I develop quantiative methods for understanding animal behavior. Through leveraging large behavioral datasets and applying both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, I try to understand how animals move through and consequently change their environment, and how the environment feeds back on animals to affect their future movements. I believe that neural circuits can only be properly understood when viewed in light of this complete closed sensorimotor loop.
