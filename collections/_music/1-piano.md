title: "Piano"

I have played piano for more than 20 years, and was taught by the late Margaret Charles in my hometown of Aberdeen. While at university, I was chairman of the Pembroke College Music Society from 2011-2012. I have performed regularly as a soloist and accompanist since my school years, including at the Aberdeen Music Festival (where I won an award for best pianist in 2008), regular recitals at university, performances at graduation ceremonies, and other one-off recitals. I love making music with others, so please feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you want to play together. I am classically trained, but I also enjoy playing film and tv music - and I'm trying to learn jazz!
