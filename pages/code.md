I started programming in Python during my PhD. I have extensive experience with object-oriented programming (OOP), data science (numpy, scipy, sklearn), image processing (opencv, skimage), and GUI programming (PyQt). I have written a few libraries that are publically available that you can learn about here. These are mostly hobby projects or projects I use personally in my research. You are welcome to try out any of my code and report any bugs you might find &#128512;. You can find all my repos on <a href="{{ site.data.settings.social.github.link }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
